### Hi, I'm Chris Roth, a Senior Data Scientist at [Preteckt](https://www.preteckt.com).

I'm currently onboarding with the Data Science team at Preteckt, alternating between learning material that is new to me (which can feel like driking from a fire hydrant), and meeting the friendly people I'll be working with.

I've spent most of my career as a Data Scientist and Researcher, mostly working on the [OSIRIS](https://research-groups.usask.ca/osiris) satellite mission at the University of Saskatchewan.

This page is intended to help others get a picture of who I am, especially those who haven't worked with me before. If that's why you are here, I look forward to working with you.

## About Me

* I love learning new things, especially in the fields of mathematics and programming, but really just about anything.
If you are passionate about it, I'd love to learn it from you.
I love teaching others about anything I know that they are interested or motivated to learn about.
I continued to tutor physics students long after I needed to for the money, mostly for the joy of seeing them do well (and also for the extra Christmas spending money).

* I enjoy meeting new people and connecting with those I know. Tell me about what you love about work. Tell me about what's important to you outside of work.

* If I get the chance to make you something to eat it will likely be a Neapolitan style pizza, unless it is your birthday, in which case it will be crÃªpes. If you get the chance to make me a meal, I'll eat whatever you like making.

* I grew up and still live in a small town (~1200 people). Ask me anything about small town life if you are curious.

* I married my high school sweetheart. Twenty+ years later she is just as sweet to me as ever. We have five children that fill our lives with fun and activity.

* I've travelled to Scotland, Germany, Prague, Lebanon, Mexico, and Tokyo. I'd love it if this list continues to grow.

## Further Details

* I've written my personal [philosophy of data science](https://github.com/czroth/philosophy-of-data-science). If you are interested in my views on data science, or would like to dialogue on the values and responsibilities of a data scientist, please read and talk to me about it.
