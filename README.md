### Hi, I'm Chris Roth, Head of Data Science at [Preteckt](https://www.preteckt.com).

We use machine learning (ML) to predict maintenance issues in vehicles before they cause downtime. Our work includes data modelling and analysis to categorize anomalous conditions in vehicular systems. The Data Science team collaborates with Preteckt's Software Engineering and Diesel Technician teams to provide Vehicle Prognostics as a Service.

My background in data science comes from working on [OSIRIS](https://research-groups.usask.ca/osiris), a Canadian satellite instrument in operation aboard the Swedish Odin satellite. Launched in 2001, OSIRIS has collected two decades of high resolution spectral data of the atmosphere to provide information on the extent to which humans are changing the atmospheric environment, specifically through the study of ozone. As Senior Analyst and Operations Engineer, I was responsible for the data processing pipeline for the instrument.

My work has been published in peer-reviewed journals and has been used to inform global policy decisions on climate.

This page is intended to help others get an [idea](#about-me) of who I am, especially those who haven't worked with me before. If that's why you are here, I look forward to [working](#working-together) with you.

## About Me

* I love learning new things, especially in the fields of physics, mathematics, and programming, but really just about anything.
If you are passionate about it, I'd love to learn it from you.
I love teaching others about anything they are interested or motivated to learn about.
  * Currently, I'm bing watching https://www.youtube.com/arjancodes

* I married my high school sweetheart. Twenty-plus years later we are still sweethearts. We have five children that fill our lives with fun and activity.

* I enjoy meeting new people and connecting with those I know. Tell me about what you love about work. Tell me about what's important to you outside of work.

* I grew up and still live in a small town (~1200 people). Two of my three closest friends have chickens. Ask me anything about small town life if you are curious.

* If I get the chance to make you something to eat it will likely be a Neapolitan style pizza, unless it is your birthday, in which case it will be crÃªpes. If you get the chance to make me a meal, I will happily eat whatever you make.

* I've travelled to Italy, Scotland, Germany, Czechia, Lebanon, Mexico, and Japan.

## Working Together

Here are a few things to know about me to help us get started working together.

* I view work as a **creative** process. I enjoy being innovative to solve problems, or to refine and expand what already exists.
  * How can things be made easier, more efficient, or more robust?
  * Is there anything that could be added to make it better?

* Work is **learning**, learning the new and becoming more efficient at the old.

* I view work as a **collaborative** process. Through collaboration, we can accomplish more, *better.*
I am most productive when others depend on me and I depend on others. Everyone is winning when we are all performing to our strengths and allowing each other to perform to theirs.

* I view most work as **in progess,** meaning things are still getting better. Things need not be perfect before they are seen by teammates. I value feedback as helpful as it quickens the quality process. If I offer you feedback, it comes from that desire.

## For Fellow Nerds

* My linux journey has been Ubuntu (2012), to Arch (2017), currently Manjaro (2019-present)
* I use a blue switch mechanical keyboard
* I love the terminal
* My IDE is PyCharm
* My most used Python packages are Pandas, NumPy, SciPy
* I have contributed to a few open source projects:
  * the linux kernel (a very small but useful commit)
  * Xarray (think Pandas, but n-dimensional)
  * django-taggit

## Further Reading

* I've written a personal [philosophy of data science](https://github.com/czroth/philosophy-of-data-science). If you are interested in my views on data science, or would like to dialogue on the values and responsibilities of a data scientist, please read and talk to me about it.
